Configuration file supplied: Config1.conf
output received: logfile.lgf


Another trial was performed by taking metadata1.mdf as metadata file, which has to be replaced in Config1.conf file.

We can run this program by simple giving make command in Shell and passing configuration file as argument.

For eg:
make 
./Assignment1 Config1.conf

This will produce output in the same directory.
Depending upon the logging input at Configuration file, it will generate output at Monitor and/or LogFile.
